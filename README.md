Econometrics course

In this project, i have a highest score in this term paper part, so i tried to answer what factors determine football player salary and used linear regression in this task. Please keep in mind, this regression in econometrics course aim to causality analysis not predictive analysis. so i don't need to split train and test set or improve model like ensemble learning.

FYI: i will upload other projects soon.
