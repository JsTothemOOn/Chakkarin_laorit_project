# Chakkarin_laorit_project
Econometrics course 

In this project, i have a highest score in this term paper part. I tried to answer what factors determine value of football player and used linear regression in stata(statistical software) but i can do these in another version like python or r. Please keep in mind, this regression in econometrics course aim to causality analysis not predictive analysis. So i don't need to split train and test set or improve model like ensemble learning. 

FYI: I will upload other projects soon.
